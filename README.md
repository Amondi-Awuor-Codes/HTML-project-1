# HTML Project 1

Just another HTML project, built as part of my learning journey in web development.  
It demonstrates:

- Basic HTML structure (headings, paragraphs)
- Embedding images, audio, and video
- Internal links and lists
- Forms for collecting user input
- Simple navigation and page sections

The project is designed to practice HTML fundamentals and create a simple portfolio webpage.
Or so I believe...
