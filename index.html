          <p>
            I am Amondi Awuor, a curious and passionate learner with a keen interest in technology and creative problem-solving.
            I enjoy exploring coding, web development, and data science, and I am always eager to apply new knowledge to real-world projects.
            My approach to learning is hands-on, and I thrive when I can combine analytical thinking with creativity to build meaningful solutions.
            Beyond technology, I love writing and expressing ideas through stories and projects that can inspire or educate others.
        </p>

                In addition to my technical pursuits, I am committed to personal growth and community engagement. I value collaboration and learning
                from diverse perspectives, believing that teamwork and shared knowledge lead to the best outcomes. My goal is to continuously challenge myself,
                grow my skills, and contribute positively to projects, organizations, and communities I am part of. I approach each opportunity with enthusiasm,
                dedication, and a mindset geared toward innovation and impact.

    <h2> Animals as a metaphor of human beings </h2>  
    <p> 
        In literature and art, animals are often used as metaphors to represent human traits,
        behaviors, and societal roles. This technique allows creators to explore complex human experiences.
